World Population Analysis and finding trend in the dataset such as High Fertility Rate amongst Africa's countries

# Introduction:
This project utilizes Microsoft Excel to analyze global population data obtained from Census.gov. The objective is to identify and present key population trends and insights. Through Excel's data processing and visualization capabilities, I have dissected growth rates, age distributions, and fertility rates across various regions. Nevertheless, this approach facilitates a clear understanding of the current demographic landscape.

# Analysis

# Dashboard:

In Excel, the dashboard provides a detailed analysis of the global population. The dashboard is structured to give a comprehensive view of population metrics, including total numbers, growth rates, median ages, and dependency ratios. Through interactive charts and graphs, we examine the variations and trends from 1950 to 2024, with particular attention to the high fertility rates observed in Africa. The data is organized to facilitate easy comparison between different countries and regions which shows the demographic changes over time. 

# Fertility Rate Analysis:

World Map Plot: A geographic representation displaying the fertility rates across the globe with a focus on Africa, highlighting the regions with the highest fertility rates.

Line Chart: A time-series analysis that traces the average fertility rates from 2019 to 2024, showing Africa's rates as consistently higher in comparison to other regions.

Scatter Plot: An illustration of the relationship between the average age of females and fertility rates, with African countries depicted as having high fertility rates alongside a lower average age of females.

Correlation Plot: A graphic demonstrating the strong positive correlation, with a coefficient of 1.00, between fertility rates and under-5 mortality rates, specifically within the African context.

Combo Chart: A dual-axis chart where the fertility rates of the top 5 African countries are presented as columns, juxtaposed with their under-5 mortality rates, also in columns. Superimposed on the same chart are lines representing the World's Average Fertility Rate and the World's Average Under-5 Mortality Rate, for comparative analysis.
